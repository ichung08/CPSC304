## Summary
The domain of our application is in the world of online video games, particularly Nintendoâ€™s popular video game: Super Smash Bros. The application is for Super Smash Bros players, tournament organizers, and fans to find information about matches, tournament information, and  player statistics. 

Our application stores information about players (e.g., ranking, wins, losses) playing in a tournament, storing information on the character they play, the stages played on, and the game modes they use. This information is useful to view players' career statistics and tournament information for players and fans to follow the Super Smash Bros esports scene more closely. Furthermore, this information can help tournament organizers with streams and event inforamtion, as well as help players keep track of their progress.
