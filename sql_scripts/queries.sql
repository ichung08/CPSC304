/* 1) Query: INSERT - DONE
The user should be able to specify what values to insert. 
The insert operation should affect more than one table 
(i.e., an insert should occur on a table with a foreign key). 
The chosen query and table(s) should make sense given the context of the application.*/

/* 1. Zelda already exists in the table */
INSERT INTO Ability
VALUES ("Zelda", "Arrow", "Wind", "Transform", "Fire");

/* 2. Insert character first in Smash_Character, then insert their abilities in Ability */
INSERT INTO Smash_Character
VALUES ("Mii Fighters", "Yellow");

INSERT INTO Ability
VALUES ("Mii Fighters", "Yoga", "Breathe", "Stretch", "Kick"); 

/* 3. Error: Ability cannot be added, since this character does not exist in our Super Smash Bros records.*/
INSERT INTO Ability
VALUES ("Mickey Mouse", "Wave", "Hug", "Hello", "Sing");

/* Jessica on Piazza for 1) INSERT
Depending on the context of the situation for insert, you may end up in one of three situations:

1. Foreign key value already exists in the table so you can insert the tuple with no problems.
2. Foreign key value does not exist yet so you need to first run an insert into the table before inserting the value the user has chosen. This option may not make sense given the context you are using insert for.
3. Return an error to the user saying this insert cannot go through because <some reasonable and understandable-to-the-average-non-computer-scientist reason here>.
Scenarios 1 + 2 or 1 + 3 are reasonable combinations to have your application handle. */

/* 2) Query: DELETE - DONE
Implement a cascade-on-delete situation (or an alternative that was agreed to by the TA if the DB system doesnâ€™t provide this). 
The user should be able to choose what values to delete. The tables that the delete operation will run on can be chosen by the group. 
The chosen query and table(s) should make sense given the context of the application. */

- the tournament itself (Tournament) 
- games scheduled that were supposed to be scheduled then (Game_Tournament) */

/* 3) Query: UPDATE - DONE
The user should be able to specify whichever value(s) to update (i.e., any number of values in one or more columns). 
The group can choose which table to run this query on. The chosen query and table(s) should make sense given the context of the application. */

The user is able to specify the filtering conditions for a given table. 
That is, the user is able to determine what shows up in the WHERE clause.
The group can choose which table to run this query on.

The user is able to choose any number of attributes to view from any relation in the database. 
Non-selected attributes must not appear in the result. 
One or more tables in the relation must contain at least four attributes.*/

Use case: Collecting data to see the number of competitive players in certain countries for marketing promotions*/

/* 6) Query: Join - DONE
Create one query in this category, which joins at least 2 tables and performs a meaningful query, 
and provide an interface for the user to execute this query. 
The user must provide at least one value to qualify in the WHERE clause 
(e.g. join the Customer and the Transaction table to find the names and phone numbers of all customers who have purchased a specific item). 
The group can choose which tables will be affected by the query. 
The query and chosen table(s) should make sense given the context of the application.*/

1) Player's username

Create one query that requires the use of aggregation 
(min, max, average, or count are all fine), 
and provide an interface (e.g., HTML button/dropdown, etc.) for the user to execute this query. 
The group can choose which table to run this query on.

The query and chosen table(s) should make sense given the context of the application. */

/* This query calculates the number of players in each country that has more than 2 players and orders the results by the number of players in descending order.

/* 9) Query: Nested Aggregation with GROUP BY - DONE
Create one query that finds some aggregated value for each group 
(e.g., use a nested subquery, such as finding the average number of items purchased per customer, subject to some constraint). 
Some examples for the Sailors table are given in the project specs. 
Note the difference between this query and the above Aggregation Query. 
You must use separate distinct queries for this criterion and the Aggregation Query (i.e., do not double dip).
It is fine to use a view to get the desired behaviour.
The query and chosen table(s) should make sense given the context of the application.*/

3) If a player has played in all games for the tournament, their username will be returned by the outer SELECT statement.
